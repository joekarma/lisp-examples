Lisp Examples
=============

This repository is a place for me to put little demo Lisp projects
that don't belong anywhere else. It's for illustrative pieces of code
that are too complicated (as in, spread across too many files) for
gists but too simple to have repositories of their own.

Currently, the following projects live here:

## [Project Modules](https://github.com/joekarma/lisp-examples/tree/master/module-loading-demo)
   
This project is my attempt at getting an automated loading system
working for modules of code in a project. An example use case is for
websites. By dropping a bundle of code into my website's modules
directory I'd like to have said code loaded by the site when it's
booted.   

That's all for now!
