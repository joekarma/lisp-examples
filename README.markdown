Lisp Examples

## About This Repository

This repository is a place for me to put those tiny Lisp demos that
don't belong anywhere else. It's for illustrative snippets of code
that are too complicated (as in, spread across too many files) for
Gists but too simple to have repositories of their own.

## Examples Index

The following is a complete list of projects in this repository. Each
project corresponds to a subfolder; clicking the project heading will
go to that subfolder on github. I will keep this list up to date as I
add new bits of example (if not exemplary) code.

### [Lisp Project Modules](https://github.com/joekarma/lisp-examples/tree/master/module-loading-demo)
   
This project is my attempt at getting an automated loading system
working for modules of code in a project. An example use case is for
websites. By dropping a bundle of code into my website's modules
directory I'd like to have said code loaded by the site when it's
booted.   

That's all for now!
