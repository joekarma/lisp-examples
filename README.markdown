Lisp Examples
=============

## About

This repository is a place for me to put those tiny Lisp demos that
don't belong anywhere else. It's for illustrative snippets of code
that are too complicated (as in, spread across too many files) for
Gists but too simple to have repositories of their own.

### [Lisp Project Modules](https://github.com/joekarma/lisp-examples/tree/master/module-loading-demo)
   
This project is my attempt at getting an automated loading system
working for modules of code in a project. An example use case is for
websites. By dropping a bundle of code into my website's modules
directory I'd like to have said code loaded by the site when it's
booted.   

That's all for now!
